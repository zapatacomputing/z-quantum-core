    How to use:
    1. Inherit this class (remember to start name of the class with "Test"
    2. In the same module define fixture called "optimizer".

    Basic usage pattern:

    @pytest.fixture
    def optimizer():
        return MyOptimizer()


    class TestMyOptimizer(OptimizerTests): # Inherits all tests from this class
         def test_some_new_feature(self, optimizer): # new test
             ....

    Notice that the `optimizer` fixture can be parametrized if you wish to
    perform tests for various configurations of your optimizer.
